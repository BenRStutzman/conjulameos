Welcome to Conjuglameos - a lame version of [conjuguemos.com](https://www.conjuguemos.com), but customizable with whatever verbs you want!

# Adding verbs
To add verbs, edit `src/verbs.txt`. Just follow the spacing pattern of the existing verbs, or use these instructions if you want them spelled out:
1. Separate each verb section (e.g. all the conjugations of 'querer')
   with two blank lines.
2. Within each verb section, separate each tense section (e.g. all the
   conjugations in the presentetense) with one blank line.
3. Within each tense section, put the tense name first (e.g. 'presente') on its
   own line, and the pronoun/conjugation pairs on the following lines.
4. Within each pronoun/conjugation pair, separate the pronoun and the
   conjugation with a space (e.g. 'eu quero').
5. For conjugations that work for multiple pronouns, separate each pronoun
   with a forward slash (e.g. 'ele/ela/você quer').
6. For conjugations with multiple correct answers, separate each conjugation
   with a forward slash (e.g. 'tu diz/dize').
7. For conjugations that apply to all pronouns, include at least one space
   before the conjugation (e.g. '  querido' for partípio).
